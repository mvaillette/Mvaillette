I’m an artist. I’m homeless. Art saves me. This blog is for my sanity.

Yay rainbows.

I made that in the hospital. Too much change at once. Blew up.

I am the scapegoat, though. Doesn’t matter what I do. Invalidation, yelling, denials of reality. Creepy shit.

If not for my art I would be dead.

But I have my art. And I am more alive than ever. :)
