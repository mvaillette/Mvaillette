### Current Focus

Right now Matt's life is in flux. He is homeless and speaking in third person. He has no sizable work space or computer.

So he focuses on his sketchbook and art as therapy.

### Bigger Picture of Matt

Matt never did like this third person thing.

He is creative because he had to be. Matt favors improvisation. He keeps ahit raw no matter the medium.

And he works with blazing speed!

Matt favors drawing techniques. When he does use paint, it is applied from tubes or bottles and mixed on canvas... And often used with drawing media. 

He uses digital tools too.
